Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java
======================

The Apache Santuario™ project is aimed at providing implementation of the primary security standards for XML:

 * XML-Signature Syntax and Processing
 * XML Encryption Syntax and Processing.

This repository contains the Apache XML Security for Java subproject of Apache
Santuario. This library includes the standard JSR-105 (Java XML Digital
Signature) API, a mature DOM-based implementation of both XML Signature and
XML Encryption, as well as a more recent StAX-based (streaming) XML Signature
and XML Encryption implementation.
